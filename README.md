# python-playground

Welcome to my Python Playground! 🐍  
This repo is a growing collection of small Python scripts, experiments, and learning snippets created while exploring the Python universe.

The goal is to understand core Python concepts – from syntax and data types to more advanced topics like OOP, file handling, and automation – in a clean, beginner-friendly way.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder or script represents a focused concept or mini-project.  
Expect things to be simple, modular, and easy to grasp:

- Clean code with helpful comments
- Descriptive filenames and folder structure
- No unnecessary dependencies – just Python, pure and simple

## 🎯 Why this repo?

This space is where I break things, try new ideas, and deepen my understanding of Python fundamentals.  
Unlike [`python-projects`](https://github.com/tom-seidel/python-projects), which will feature more complete and polished apps, this playground is for exploration and learning.

Think of it as my personal Python lab. 🧪

## ✅ Topics covered (so far)

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scopes
- Lists, dictionaries, and loops
- Conditionals and logic
- File I/O
- Modules and packages
- Object-Oriented Programming (in progress)
- CLI tools and automation (coming soon)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo will continue to evolve as I dive deeper into Python, from scripting tools to more complex back-end concepts.

Feedback, ideas, or contributions are always welcome!
